# 🍷 WineExper
WineExpert is a machine learning project that leverages **Random Forest** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify wine samples based on their quality attributesThe project aims to assist wine enthusiasts and professionals in assessing wine quality using predictive modeling techniques

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Class Classification** Predicts wine quality across multiple categories using advanced machine learning algorithm
- **Model Optimization** Incorporates hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance and prevent overfittin
- **Scalable ML Pipeline** Integrates feature scaling, stratified sampling, and model explainability techniques such as confusion matrices and feature importance analysi

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PranjalBisen/WineExpert.git
   cd WineExpert
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'env\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset*: Ensure you have the wine quality dataset in the appropriate fort.
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook WineQuality.ipynb
   ```

3. **Follow the notebook instructions*: The notebook contains step-by-step guidance on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluatn.
